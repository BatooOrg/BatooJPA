	 * the entity is otherwise mapped to a secondary table, this

	 * additional table(s).  Entity relationships for which the locked
	 * entity contains the foreign key will also be locked, but not
	 * the state of the referenced entities (unless those entities are
	 * explicitly locked).  Element collections and relationships for
	 * which the entity does not contain the foreign key (such as
	 * relationships that are mapped to join tables or unidirectional
	 * one-to-many relationships for which the target entity contains
	 * the foreign key) will not be locked by default.

	 * with a value of <code>PessimisticLockScope.EXTENDED</code>.

	 * be locked (unless those entities are explicitly locked).
