/**
 * Flush mode setting.
 *
 * <p> When queries are executed within a transaction, if
 * <code>FlushModeType.AUTO</code> is set on the {@link
 * javax.persistence.Query Query} or {@link javax.persistence.TypedQuery
 * TypedQuery} object, or if the flush mode setting for the
 * persistence context is <code>AUTO</code> (the default) and a flush
 * mode setting has not been specified for the <code>Query</code> or
 * <code>TypedQuery</code> object, the persistence provider is
 * responsible for ensuring that all updates to the state of all
 * entities in the persistence context which could potentially affect
 * the result of the query are visible to the processing of the
 * query. The persistence provider implementation may achieve this by
 * flushing those entities to the database or by some other means.
 * <p> If <code>FlushModeType.COMMIT</code> is set, the effect of
 * updates made to entities in the persistence context upon queries is
 * unspecified.
 *
 * <p> If there is no transaction active, the persistence provider
 * must not flush to the database.
 *
